Need help with:

- Adding link and badge for license - Why is the variable working in the render license function but not the switch statements?
- 28-Stu-Mini-Project: Can you help me understand what's happening with this code? Esp. variables and parameters
    Start with line 62 and the generateHTML(answers) function.
- 12-Stu-Parameter-Check: process.argv <-- wtf is this??
- 16-Stu-maths: What is happening on lines 8 and 9?
